Implementation of the Miller-Myers algorithm for edit distance, specifically the linear-space modification.

## How to Use ##

1. Open file "run.py"
2. Scroll down to \_\_main\_\_
3. Set u and v to your desired strings
4. Run "run.py" with python 2 to get edit distance / optimal alignment for edit distance
